# Changelog

## 1.1.0 (Stable)

- Icons
  - Added AI-styled SVG app icon at `assets/images/icons/ai/app-icon.svg`.
  - Updated `scripts/generate-icon.js` to prefer the AI SVG and fall back to the PNG logo.
  - Regenerated multi-size PNGs and `build/icon.ico` for Electron packaging.

- Game Master UI
  - Enhanced `game-master-settings.html` with:
    - SFX toggle and beep hooks for Apply/Save actions (non-blocking `AudioContext`).
    - Tunable background overlay intensity via a CSS variable and slider.
    - Auto-swap header icons to AI variants when available.

- Build & Release
  - Bumped version to `1.1.0`.
  - Confirmed GitHub Actions workflow `release.yml` to build and publish on tag `v*` using `npm run release`.

Notes: If the AI SVG is missing, the icon generation gracefully falls back to the existing PNG logo.
