A lightweight, offline-friendly game inspired by Deal or No Deal. Configure prizes, play rounds, and experiment with strategies. Now featuring a Max Prize Amount model: prizes scale from $0 up to your configured maximum, with $0 traps always shown as $0.
Highlights

    What's New in v2.0.4

        Liquid Glass Theme: Modern UI integration for Settings and modals.
    Max Prize Amount setting replaces legacy "Prize Scale Multiplier".
    Prizes auto-scale from $0 to your chosen maximum; zero traps are forced to $0.
    Settings persist locally via localStorage and can be overridden per game.
    Runs in a web browser or as a Windows desktop app via Electron.
    Randomize case positions and reusable templates for rapid session setup.

## Quick Start
### Run in your browser (local)

    Open a terminal in the project root.
    Start a simple server:
        npx http-server -p 8080
    Open:
        Settings: http://127.0.0.1:8080/game-master-settings.html
        Game: http://127.0.0.1:8080/deal-or-no-deal.html
        Tip: If port is busy, try -p 8123.

### Windows desktop app (Electron)

Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, Git (optional), Windows 10/11.

    Install dependencies: npm install
    Start the app: npm run start
    Build installer: npm run build
        The build uses electron-builder and the configuration in package.json.
    Publish a release (optional): npm run release
        Requires GITHUB_TOKEN in your environment with repo publish permissions.

### Download (Releases)

## Gameplay & Configuration
### Max Prize Amount

    Open game-master-settings.html.
    Set "Max Prize Amount ($)" â€” examples preview update automatically (e.g., $0, $1,250, $10,000, $100,000).
    Persisted to localStorage under gameSettings.maxPrizeAmount.
    The game page (deal-or-no-deal.html) uses this value to generate prize cases from $0 up to the max.
    Zero-amount traps are rendered as $0.
    The Game page does not include a "Max Prize" input; configure the amount exclusively in Game Master Settings.

### How prizes are generated

    Values are distributed from $0 up to maxPrizeAmount using an exponential spread for a satisfying curve.
    Traps that would be negative or zero are normalized to $0.
    Legacy prizeScaleMultiplier is removed; maxPrizeAmount is the single source of truth.

## Tutorials
1) Classic Play

    Set Max Prize Amount ($) on the Settings page.
    Click "Save Settings".
    Open the Game page and start a new round.
    Make selections, review offers, and decide: Deal or No Deal.

2) Custom one-off session

    Open the Settings page and set "Max Prize Amount ($)" to your desired value.
    Click "Save Settings", then start a new game. The Game page will use the saved value.

3) Designer mode (optional)

    Want a different distribution curve (e.g., more mid-tier values)?
    Open deal-or-no-deal.html and adjust the prize generation function accordingly.
    Keep $0 traps enforced for clarity.

### Scripts

    npm run start â€” Launch Electron app.
    npm run build â€” Build Windows installer via electron-builder.
    npm run release â€” Build and publish a release to GitHub (requires GITHUB_TOKEN).
    npm run icons â€” Generate application icons from build/icon.png.

### Build & Publish Notes

    electron-builder is configured to publish to Snapwave333/Shillornoshill_public.
    See RELEASE_NOTES.md for version details; tag releases as vX.Y.Z.
    Large binaries should use Git LFS or be attached to Releases instead of tracked in Git.
    Build artifacts like *.zip are excluded from packaged app via electron-builder files config.

### AI-generated media

    The banner/logo (hill-or-no-shill-logo.png) and concept art may be AI-generated.
    You can add more AI-generated images under assets/extracted/images/ and reference them in the UI.
    Suggestions:
        Gameplay storyboard images
        Case/prize concept art
        Themed backgrounds

### Asset prompts and specs

See assets/ai/prompts.md for standardized prompts, sizes, and filenames for:

    Backgrounds (Game/Settings),
    Banker portrait,
    26 numbered briefcases,
    UI icons (start, settings, restart, banker, offer),
    Logo variants.

Placeholder assets are already checked in under assets/images/ so you can preview layout before replacing them with your generated images.

## Troubleshooting

    Blank page in Electron: run npm install, then npm run start.
    Windows SmartScreen: click "More info" â†’ "Run anyway" for unsigned builds.
    Large file warnings on push: configure Git LFS for big binaries (https://git-lfs.github.com) or add them to Releases.
    Port 8080 in use: change port npx http-server -p 8081.

## Roadmap

    Curve editor for prize distributions.
    Session analytics and visualization.
    In-app settings panel for Electron build.
